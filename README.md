# Machine-Learning
Repository containing some projects regarding the main machine learning models completed by me for self learning purpose.  
Everything here was written in the Jupyter Notebook environment using Python 3.  
The data used in each project can be found in the project folder.  

## Contents  
  
  * ### **Machine Learning**  
    
    * [Predicting Car Prices](https://github.com/LucaMagini/Machine-Learning/blob/master/K-Nearest%20Neighbors/Predicting%20Car%20Prices.ipynb): 
In this project , we'll try to predict a car's market price using a K-Nearest Neighbors model. The data set contains information on various cars. 
    * [Predicting House Sale Prices](https://github.com/LucaMagini/Machine-Learning/blob/master/Linear%20Regression/Predicting%20House%20Sale%20Prices.ipynb): In this project our aim is to predict house sale prices using the linear regression model. We'll fit the model using two different approaches and use some techniques for cleaning, transforming and selecting features.
    * [Predicting Bike Rentals](https://github.com/LucaMagini/Machine-Learning/blob/master/Decision%20Trees%20-%20Random%20Forest/Predicting%20Bike%20Rentals.ipynb): In this project, we'll try to predict the total number of bikes people rented in a given hour. To accomplish this, we'll create a few different machine learning models and evaluate their performance. When possible we'll be using a fixed seed for random algorithms to make the test reproducible.
    * [Building a Handwritten Digits Classifier](https://github.com/LucaMagini/Machine-Learning/blob/master/Deep%20Learning/Building%20a%20Handwritten%20Digits%20Classifier.ipynb): In this project we'll observe the limitations of traditional machine learning model for image classification and we'll train, test and improve a few different deep neural networks for image classification.

***Libraries**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn*
